# Lending-Club-Case-Study
Lending a loan is "risky" decision that a company takes .To avoid financial loss a company must choose to finance people cautiously.

The study identifies the risky loan applicants who might end up being a "defaulter" and can significantly bring financial loss to the lending company.
A rigourous analysis is done to identify those driving factors which helps us narrow down to pinpoint who might end up being a defaulter.

## General Information
- About:
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the risk of loan default in a consumer finance company. By analyzing past loan applicant data, we aim to identify patterns that can predict the likelihood of default, helping the company make informed decisions on loan approvals.
- Background:
Consumer finance companies face significant risks when lending money, particularly the risk of applicants defaulting on loans. Understanding these risks through data analysis is crucial for minimizing financial losses and optimizing the loan approval process.
- Business Probem:
The project seeks to solve the problem of risk assessment in loan approval. By predicting which applicants are likely to default, the company can mitigate risks by adjusting loan terms, denying high-risk loans, or offering higher interest rates to compensate for the risk.
- Dataset used
The dataset includes information about past loan applicants, such as demographic details, loan characteristics, and whether the applicants defaulted on their loans. This historical data will be used to identify trends and patterns associated with loan defaults.
