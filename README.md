## General Information
- About:
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the risk of loan default in a consumer finance company. By analyzing past loan applicant data, we aim to identify patterns that can predict the likelihood of default, helping the company make informed decisions on loan approvals.
- Background:
Consumer finance companies face significant risks when lending money, particularly the risk of applicants defaulting on loans. Understanding these risks through data analysis is crucial for minimizing financial losses and optimizing the loan approval process.
- Business Probem:
The project seeks to solve the problem of risk assessment in loan approval. By predicting which applicants are likely to default, the company can mitigate risks by adjusting loan terms, denying high-risk loans, or offering higher interest rates to compensate for the risk.
- Dataset used
The dataset includes information about past loan applicants, such as demographic details, loan characteristics, and whether the applicants defaulted on their loans. This historical data will be used to identify trends and patterns associated with loan defaults.



## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
Demographic attributes such as age, income level, and employment status significantly influence the likelihood of loan default.
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
Loan characteristics, including loan amount, loan term, and interest rate, are strong indicators of the default risk.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
Applicants with a history of defaults or high credit utilization are more likely to default on new loans, emphasizing the need for thorough credit history checks.
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
Implementing risk-based pricing and stringent approval criteria based on predictive models can significantly reduce the company's financial losses.
